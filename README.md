<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

This is a project done for Software Development Skills: Mobile 2024-25 -course.
The main (and only) function of the software is to add users exercises to a gym sheet that the user can then see and interact with (kinda). The whole code is very simple and mainly used for learning how to use recyclerview and how to send data between views. 

There are many features I would have wanted to add but ended up not committing to (for example switching the background color of different exercises on the sheet or having the checkbox actually do something).
I will update the software on a later date as my own project unrelated to studies if I feel like it.

The repository also has a learning diary where I reflect on videos about topics I had to learn about for this project.
Material from my exercises can be found here: https://github.com/Vauhtin0rsu/SDS-Mobile-Coursework
