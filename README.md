<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

This is a project done for Software Development Skills: Mobile 2024-25 -course, made by <b>Noora Parkko</b>
The main (and only) function of the software is to add users exercises to a gym sheet that the user can then see and interact with (kinda). The whole code is very simple and mainly used for learning how to use recyclerview and how to send data between views. 

There are many features I would have wanted to add but ended up not committing to (for example switching the background color of different exercises on the sheet or having the checkbox actually do something).
I will update the software on a later date as my own project unrelated to studies if I feel like it.

For the course completion the repository has a learning diary where I reflect on topics I had to learn for this project and a video (as a mp4 file) showing how my application works. 
Material from my exercises can be found here: https://github.com/Vauhtin0rsu/SDS-Mobile-Coursework

<h2>HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT?</h2>

To be able to test this program, you have to import the project to Android Studio on your own computer. 
First you create a new project from version control:

You copy the URL of this project and paste it to Android Studio:

Wait for Android Studio to clone the project and run the app on your device to test it out. 
You obviously don't need the README.md, learning diary or the mp4 file to run the app :D
